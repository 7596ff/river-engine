# River Engine Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-03-23

## Status Legend

- 🔴 **Not Started**
- 🟡 **In Progress**
- 🟢 **Complete**
- ⚪ **Deferred**

---

## Quick Wins

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Timezone support | 🟢 | `PREFERENCES.toml` with chrono-tz |
| Shell profile loading | 🟢 | Bash `-l` flag for login shell |
| Message history access | 🟢 | Bidirectional conversations, `sync_conversation` tool |

---

## Monitoring & Observability

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Health endpoint | 🟢 | Rich `/health` with metrics |
| Agent metrics | 🟢 | `AgentMetrics` struct, context tracking |
| Health policy | 🟢 | `HealthPolicy` with degraded/needs-attention states |
| Systemd watchdog | 🟢 | `sd_notify` integration |
| Structured logging | 🟢 | JSON logging support |

**Files:** `metrics.rs`, `policy.rs`, `watchdog.rs`, `logging.rs`

---

## Agent Core

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Agent loop | 🟢 | Wake/think/act/settle cycle |
| Context persistence | 🟢 | Save/restore conversation state |
| Context rotation | 🟢 | Auto-rotate when approaching limit |
| Subagent spawning | 🟢 | Task workers and long-running subagents |
| Tool system | 🟢 | Registry, executor, 20+ tools |

**Files:** `loop/`, `subagent/`, `tools/`

---

## Embeddings

**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

**Architecture:** Declarative sync (NixOS-style)

```
workspace/embeddings/     Sync Service      sqlite-vec
├── memory.md        ──→  (hash, diff,  ──→  (vectors)
├── notes/*.md            chunk, embed)
└── context/*.md
```

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| sqlite-vec integration | 🔴 | Load extension, create virtual tables |
| Chunker | 🔴 | Split markdown into ~400 token pieces |
| Sync service | 🔴 | Scan folder, hash files, diff against DB |
| Embed client | 🟢 | Exists: `EmbeddingClient` in river-gateway |
| Search API | 🔴 | Query vectors with `vec_distance_cosine()` |

**Design:** See `docs/research/embedding-architecture.md`

**Principle:** The `embeddings/` folder is the source of truth. The database is derived state.

---

## Deployment

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Nix/NixOS | 🟢 | Current deployment method |
| Docker/Podman | 🔴 | Reduce Nix dependency, broader compatibility |

**Goal:** Both options, composable. Nix for declarative systems, Docker for everything else.

---

## Architecture

| Feature | Status | Depends On | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|-------|
| Module support | 🔴 | — | Foundation for extensibility |
| Skill support | 🔴 | Modules | CLI tools + metadata (OpenClaw-style) |
| MCP support | 🔴 | Modules | Model Context Protocol integration |

**Research:** See `docs/research/openclaw-*.md`

**Key insight from OpenClaw:** Skills are just CLI wrappers with `SKILL.md` metadata files. Simple and effective.

---

## Communication

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Discord adapter | 🟢 | Working |
| Bidirectional conversations | 🟢 | `conversations/` module, outgoing message tracking |
| Discord /read endpoint | 🟢 | Fetch channel history from Discord API |
| Voice chat | 🔴 | New adapter type |
| Issue tracking | 🔴 | Internal issue system for agent |

---

## Advanced

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Adversarial mind | ⚪ | Actor-spectator dialectical architecture |

**Concept:** "I" and "You" — a spectator that observes and critiques the actor's work. Needs careful design. Deferred until foundation is solid.

---

## Research

| Topic | Status | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| OpenClaw architecture | 🟢 | `docs/research/openclaw-architecture.md` |
| OpenClaw features | 🟢 | `docs/research/openclaw-features.md` |
| OpenClaw detailed | 🟢 | `docs/research/openclaw-features-detailed.md` |
| Embedding architecture | 🟢 | `docs/research/embedding-architecture.md` |

## Open Questions

1. **Adversarial mind** — Design upfront or evolve as we go?
2. **Nix vs Docker** — Both-and? Primary deployment target?

---

## Notes

- "It's a both-end situation, doesn't have to be one or the other" — on Nix vs Docker
- "We needed to figure out a strategy and we needed to fail first" — on embeddings
- "Reading OpenClaw source and sniping most of the features. Well, the good ones."
